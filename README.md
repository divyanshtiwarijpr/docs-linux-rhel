# docs-linux-rhel

1. This repository is created by me to manage my personal docmentation related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting from RHEL 6. 

2. This will be an ongoing process as there is too much confusing and contradicting information and I will try my best to filter confusing and contradicting information write only when I feel it is correct upto my knowledge.

3. Most ot the things written are tested by me first in a physical or virtual environment based on VMware Workstation Pro and/or Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean. But there may be some topics which need more hands experience and some collaboration from your side so feel free to comment and help me in this initiative.

4. The naming policy for filenames is that the filenames start with the major release version of RHEL for which the document is applicable. 

5. In case of files with no RHEL version in their filename, it suggests that a particular file is applicable for all the major and minor release versions of RHEL starting from RHEL 6.

6. I may change this policy as newer release versions of RHEL will come in the upcoming time. But I promise it will always be organized and easy to find.
