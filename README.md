# notes-linux-rhel

1. This repository is created by me to manage my personal docmentation related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting from RHEL 6. 
2. This will be an ongoing process as there is too much confusing and contradicting information and I will try my best to write only when I feel it is correct upto my knowledge.
3. Most ot the things written are tested by me first in a physical or virtual environment. But there may be some topics which need more hands experience and some collaboration from your side so feel free to comment and help me in this initiative.
4. If you feel the need for major changes in this repository please create a pull request and maybe we will merge them later.
